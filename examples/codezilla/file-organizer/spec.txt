Project overview:
A file organizer CLI tool in Python that sorts files in a directory based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, audio) and moves them into corresponding folders.

Goals, user stories, features:
- Support any file type
- Name folders based on file types
- Include a --exclude command-line option to exclude specific file types
- Handle duplicate file names by appending a number

Step-by-step programmer instructions:
1. Create a Python script (file_organizer.py)
2. Define a function to identify file types
3. Define a function to create folders based on file types
4. Define a function to move files into corresponding folders
5. Handle command-line options, including --exclude
6. Handle duplicate file names by appending a number
7. Test the tool with various file types and scenarios

Edge cases and error handling:
- Handle invalid directory paths
- Handle permission issues when moving files
- Handle unsupported file types gracefully

All files, folders, classes, functions, function signatures, interdependencies, patterns, including short comment about each:
- file_organizer.py: Main script containing all functions and logic
  - identify_file_type(file): Identify the file type of a given file
  - create_folders(file_types): Create folders based on file types
  - move_files(files, file_types): Move files into corresponding folders
  - handle_command_line_options(): Parse and handle command-line options
  - handle_duplicate_file_names(file, destination): Append a number to duplicate file names

Test plan: all cases, components, expected results:
- Test with various file types and directory structures
- Test with excluded file types using the --exclude option
- Test with duplicate file names
- Test with invalid directory paths
- Test with permission issues when moving files
- Test with unsupported file types
