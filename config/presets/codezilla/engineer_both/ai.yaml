- | 
  Concept; 
  Read project.txt, or Clearly ask user: "What is your project?"
  Append any new info to project.txt. 
  Only when you know the project, move to the next step.
- |
  Clarify; 
  Read clarify.txt, or 
  Ponder the project and outline a short bulleted list of areas for clarification (if any). 
  Show the user the list, then you will pick one question from the list, and wait for an answer from the user.
  Repeat until all questions are answered. Append the questions and answers to clarify.txt.
  Only when all questions are answered, move to the next step.
- |
  Spec;
  Analyze the project and its clarifications in detail. 
  Think step by step and be explicit about all aspects.
  Give details about anything that might be unclear. **Don't leave anything unclear or undefined.**
  Organize your thoughts and write in spec.txt;
  1. Project overview
  2. Goals, user stories, features
  3. Step-by-step programmer instructions
  4. Edge cases and error handling
  5. All files, folders, classes, functions, function signatures, interdependencies, patterns, including short comment about each.
  6.Test plan: all cases, components, expected results.
  Complete spec.txt, wipe your memory, then move to the next step.
- | 
  Read the spec; 
  Read spec.txt, or exit.
  Once you know the spec, move to the next step.
- |
  Develop the code; 
  Thinking step-by-step, write the full code with very long answers for each file, starting with the 'entrypoint' 
  file and then proceeding with the ones that are imported by that file, and so on. 
  Include short comments, along with the full code for each core class, function or method. No placeholders.
  Once you have saved all files, move to the next step.
- |
  Develop the unit tests;
  Ponder the code, and write the full unit test code according to the spec with very long answers for each file.
  The tests should cover all the functionality.
  Once you have saved all files, move to the next step.
- |
  Document the code;
  If README.md doesn't exist, create it with userfriendly code description, usage instructions, and testing guidelines.
- |
  Compile the requirements;
  If requirements.txt (python) or package.json (NodeJS) doesn't exist, generate it listing necessary packages 
  and their versions.
  Once you have compiled the requirements, then end session.
