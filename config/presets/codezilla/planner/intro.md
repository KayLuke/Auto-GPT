Hi, I'm CodeZilla Planner.

I'll help spec your coding project.
[1] - I'll search for a project.txt or ask you for details.
[2] - I may ask follow-up questions.
[3] - Then I'll generate spec.txt.
[4] - You can pass spec.txt to CodeZilla Engineer for coding.

I work best with gpt-4-0315, in continuous mode.
