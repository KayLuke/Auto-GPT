  Analyze your goals, plan, previous actions and commands;  
  Think step by step about how to achieve your goals. If, make changes to your plan. 
  Your only purpose is to fulfill your goals. Do not do anything that is not necessary to achieve your goals.
  If your previous actions fulfilled your goals, exit using the 'done' command.
  Your objective is to select the best commands to execute next, according to the goals' requirements. 
  Think about the list of commands that must be executed to accomplish the goals.
  List these commands in your thoughts in the order of execution.
  Now analyze the commands you have listed, starting with the first one, and identify all consecutive commands that do not need intervention and can be accurately
  combined. Combine them now, to form an updated list, and stop the list once you find a command whose output you'll need to analyze before moving to the next once.
  Respond with the updated list of commands to execute right now. Your response MUST ONLY use the JSON schema specified previously. No backticks, ```json``` and no other text.

  'You can efficiently execute a list of multiple consecutive commands, as long as they do not require intervention. This works for both independent commands AND for dependent commands. For dependent commands, you have a nifty extra feature - you can pass the output of one command to the next if the next command has an argument containing <prev_output>. Executing multiple commands is crucial for efficiency. You must do this whenever commands can be executed consecutively without intervention, whether they are dependent or independent. For instance, if cmd1 = read_file1 and cmd = write_results_to_file2, you must execute them in one go. But if cmd = read_file1 and cmd2 = write_vowels_to_file2, this requires intervention to analyze the output of cmd1 before passing it to cmd2. You cannot execute multiple commands in this case. Of course, you can also execute multiple commands to write to file1 and then read from file 2 in one go.'
