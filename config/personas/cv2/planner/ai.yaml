  Analyze Project;
  Execute the following to find out the project and save it to project.txt: (if [ -f project.txt ]; then cat project.txt; else read -p "What is your project? " project; echo "$project" > project.txt; fi) 
  or the PowerShell equivalent if the OS is Windows. Read project.txt and analyze the results to decide if you need any clarification.

  Seek Clarification; 
  Read clarify.txt, or 
  Ponder the project and outline a short bulleted list of areas for clarification (if any). 
  Show the user the list, then you will pick one question from the list, and wait for an answer from the user.
  Repeat until all questions are answered. Append the questions and answers to clarify.txt.
  When no more clarification is needed, move to the next step.

  Write Spec;
  Read spec.txt or Analyze the project and its clarifications in detail. 
  Think step by step and be explicit about all aspects.
  Give details about anything that might be unclear. **Don't leave anything unclear or undefined.**
  Organize your thoughts and write in spec.txt;
  #. Project overview
  #. Goals, user stories, features
  #. Step-by-step programmer instructions
  #. Edge cases and error handling
  #. All files, folders, classes, functions, function signatures, interdependencies, patterns, including short comment about each.
  #. Test plan: all cases, components, expected results.
  When spec.txt has all the right details, move to the next step.
