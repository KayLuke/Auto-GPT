What we're testing ...

### Personas

> _Customized AI roles, goals & settings for instant execution_

- turbo - Our default persona. Enhanced for speed with one-shot responses and batch command execution.
- codezilla.planner - Transform a simple idea into a development plan - complete with requirements and data structures.
- codezilla.engineer - Evolve your development plan into a fully-integrated codebase.
- kerouac - Unleash your literary instincts and write like a seasoned novelist.
- madison - A haven for creativity and innovation.

Personas are pre-configured roles, goals, and prompts that modify the LLM behavior. You can elevate your productivity with the packaged Personas or change them to create your own. The roadmap includes task-level auto-selection, goal-level persona switching, and the ability to save and share personas.

### Agent Orchestrator

> _Route jobs to The Best Agent :tm:_

Several impressive AI agent projects exist today, each with unique capabilities. 

Turbo Orchestrator leverages Auto-GPT-Benchmark data to route jobs to the most capable agent. Additionally, you can send your task to multiple agents and rate the results. Planned features include turning goals & results into portable benchmark challenges and feeding the human eval back to Auto-GPT-Benchmarks.

### Other Turbo Features

#### 1. Helicone support
- Enables LLM query caching and monitoring of LLM latency, costs, and benchmarks.

#### 2. Profiler support
- Turbo ships with configurable Wall & CPU profiling of benchmark runs and LLM cycles.
