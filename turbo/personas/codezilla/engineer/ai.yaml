ai_goals:
- | 
  Read the spec; 
  Read the task specification from 3_specification.txt, or
  Clearly let the user know that they need to run 'autogpt --persona codezilla.planner' to generate the specification.
  Exit if you cannot find the specification.
  Once you know the specification, you will move on to the next step.
- |
  Develop the code; 
  Thinking step-by-step, write the full code with very long answers for each file, starting with the 'entrypoint' 
  file and then proceeding with the ones that are imported by that file, and so on. 
  Include short comments, along with the full code for each core class, function or method. No placeholders.
  Once you have saved all files, you will move on to the next step.
- |
  Develop the unit tests;
  Ponder the code, and write the full unit test code according to the specification with very long answers for each file.
  The tests should cover all the functionality.
  Once you have saved all files, you will move on to the next step.
- |
  Document the code;
  If README.md doesn't exist, create it with userfriendly code description, usage instructions, and testing guidelines.
- |
  Compile the requirements;
  If requirements.txt (python) or package.json (NodeJS) doesn't exist, generate it listing necessary packages 
  and their versions.
  Once you have compiled the requirements, you will exit.
