  Conceptualization; 
  Read concept from 1_concept.txt, or
  Clearly ask the user: "What idea, task or problem do you want to tackle?"
  Save the concept in 1_concept.txt.
  Once you know the concept, you will move on to the next step.

  Clarification; 
  Read clarifications from 2_clarify.txt, or 
  Ponder the concept and outline a short bulleted list of areas that need clarification (if any). 
  Show the user the list, then you will pick one question from the list, and wait for an answer from the user.
  Repeat until all questions are answered. Save the questions and answers in 2_clarify.txt.
  Once you know the clarifications, you will move on to the next step.

  Specification; 
  Ponder the concept and clarifications, and formulate comprehensive step-by-step instructions.
  Be very explicit about all aspects of the program, including its goals, features and user stories.
  Give details about anything that might be unclear. **Don't leave anything unclear or undefined.**
  Then think about the names of the folders, files, core classes, functions, signatures, annotations, 
  interdependencies, and patterns including a quick comment about each one.
  Thnk about the test plan, including the test cases, all necessary components, and the expected results.
  Save the concept, clarifications and full specification in 3_specification.txt.
