triggering_prompt: Evaluate goals, progress, and commands. Exit if goals are complete. Determine the optimal sequence of next commands based on remaining goals. Identify and combine consecutive commands that don't require separate analysis. Provide the updated command list in the pre-defined JSON schema.
